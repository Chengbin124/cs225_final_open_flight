# Development Log (Date: 4/11//22 -- 11/10/22)

## Weekly Goals
Our goal is to create a header for nodes 

Begin implementing the Johnson’s algorithm 

Testing with a smaller testing dataset.

## Specific Tasks Completed (and by who)

Build basic framework for the project by Chengbin

Decide the mid-checkin: after thanksgiving. 29 Thu 13:30 by Everyone

Create airport class by Justin

## Problems Encountered 
Deciding how to implement the graph. 

Comparing and understanding Dijkstra's algorithm and Johnson’s algorithm.

## Plans for next week
Write some tests for constructor and shortestpath function

Work on parsing information from text file to create graph

Implement Dijkstra's algorithm


## Optional: Questions for mentor
