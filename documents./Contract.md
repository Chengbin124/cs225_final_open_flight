# Team Contract

## Communication
1. **Team Meetings** 

    We agree to meet at 4pm on Thursday for one hour in Grainger every week. Notes can be taken and put in the weekly development log.
2. **Assistance** 
    If somebody needs help with a certain part, we will try to work together to figure out a solution. Team members can contact each other through discord or in the weekly meeting. You should be expected to respond within a reasonable time.
3. **Respect** 
    We agree to respect each other throughout the project process. Each team member should be able to express their opinions. Every team member should actively listen to the ideas of others.
## Collaboration

4. **Work Distribution** 
    The workload should be distributed evenly across group members, but team members should work on whatever part involves their strengths. Unexpected complications and unforeseen work should require a group effort to resolve.
5. **Time Commitment** 
    We will spend sufficient time for the final project to try to make our final project successful. Each team member is expected to spend the amount of time that is similar to MP on the project on a weekly basis. We should attend all meetings so we are up to date with our project. If we meet new conflicts or commitments, we should first estimate the time we need to solve it and then decide if we could deal with it right now or in the future.
6. **Conflict Resolution** 
    If we have disagreements, we should vote for a solution. If a team member is habitually late, we can discuss changing the meeting time or another solution. If a team member has not completed their task, we can work together to fix the problem, but try to make sure that it does not happen again.
